and you may be able to control the use of cookies through your Web
browser as described in the “Use of Cookies” section below, some Web
browsers may also give you the ability to enable a “do not track”
setting. This setting sends a special signal to the Web sites you
encounter while Web browsing. This “do not track” signal is different
from disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your
browser settings, as browsers with the “do not track” setting enabled
still have the ability to accept cookies. We do not respond to Web
browser “do not track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future,

services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant
advertising.

We, our third-party service providers, advertisers or our partners also
may use cookies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements
displayed on or delivered by us and/or other networks or sites. This
also helps us, our service providers, and partners provide more relevant
advertising.

may also use "Web beacons," activity trackers, or clear. gifs, or
similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a Web
page, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors
viewing a Web page. For example, web beacons may be used to count the
users who visit a Web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a
visitor viewing that page.

You can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and
similar technologies through your browser. You may set your browser to
accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a
cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies. Blocking all
cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from

  expectations based on your relationship with us.

## _Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights_

To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described
above, please submit a verifiable User request to us by sending us a
message on our website. Only you, or a person registered with the
California Secretary of State that you authorize A act on your behalf,
may make a verifiable User request related to your personal information.
You may also make a verifiable User request on behalf of your minor
child.

You may only make a verifiable User request for access or data
portability twice within a twelve- (12)-month period. The verifiable
User request must:

- Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify
  you are the person about whom we collected personal information or
  an authorized representative.

- Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
  properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal
information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the
request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will
only use personal information provided in a verifiable User request to
verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

## _Response Timing and Format_

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable User request within forty-five
(45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we
will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will
deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve- (12-) month
period preceding the verifiable User request’s receipt. The response we
provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request,
if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to
provide your personal information that is readily useable and should
allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity
without hindrance, specifically by electronic mail communication.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable User
request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If
we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we
made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before
completing your request.

## _Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights_

direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “right
to opt-out”). We do not sell the personal information of User we

affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the User
who is between thirteen (13) and sixteen (16) years of age, or the
parent or guardian of a User less than thirteen (13) years of age.
Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future
sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your
authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the
following our webpage and sending us a message.

months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales.

information sales at any time by visiting our website and sending us a
